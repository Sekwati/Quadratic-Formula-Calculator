# Quadratic-Formula-Calculator
A Python program that calculates the two roots of a quadratic equation (x1 and x2)
A quadratic equation has two roots and two values of x. 
Write a Python program that calculates the two roots of a quadratic equation (x1 and x2). 
Ask the user to supply the coefficients (a, b, and c) of a quadratic equation to calculate x1 
and x2 using the following formulas:
ùë•1 = (-b+(b^2-4ac)^1/2)/2a

ùë•2 = (-b-(b^2-4ac)^1/2)/2a
